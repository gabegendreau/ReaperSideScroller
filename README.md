#Street Reapin'
#*WIP* 
An old-school arcade style beat 'em up sidescroller where you play as the Grim Reaper, using a scythe or Death's Touch to claim souls of marked characters while avoiding others.

This project began as a proof of concept for a class, was extended into a playable prototype for my capstone project, and is still awaiting further development. Street Reapin' was made with Unreal Engine 4.25.4 and Visual Studio 2019, using C++.

Portfolio page for this project is available at http://madebygabe.net/streetreapin.html
